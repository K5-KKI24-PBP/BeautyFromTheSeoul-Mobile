## Application Description
The proposed application, Beauty from the Seoul, serves as a comprehensive guide for skincare enthusiasts visiting or living in Seoul, South Korea. As a city renowned for its skincare products, Seoul boasts a diverse range of brands and types of skincare items.

By providing detailed product listings, user reviews, store locations, and promotion events, our application will empower users to make informed purchasing decisions‚Äî‚Äîor to get your money's worth, as they say‚Äî‚Äîwhile exploring Seoul's vibrant beauty scene.

## Modules to be Implemented
